# MICROPROCESSOR MIDTERM PROJECT
This project was given by "Mustafa Berkan Biçer" for our midterm exam. <br/>
This project had some rules: <br/> 
• A program that writes text and simple graphics to an 8x8 dot matrix screen. <br/>
• Ask the user to enter text or graphical data. <br/>
• Bonus: Add animations and scrolling text. <br/>

We completed this project with our group. Our group was four people, "Muhammed Gözlek", "Mikail Canlı", "Eren Karakaş" and "Abdurrahman Gülmez". 
This project was written in asssembly language by using emu8086. In this project, We got the input from user and used the ASCII codes of letters to display the output in dot matrix. 
We couldn't display the output in 8x8 dot matrix screen, so used 7x5 dot matrix in Emulation Kit. Our codes is running correctly for the letters of alphabet except "a". 
This project contributed us in usage of assembly language. We thanks to our Microprocessor Lecturer, "Mustafa Berkan Biçer", for giving us this project.
